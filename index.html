    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>

    <h3>I. Archery Game</h3>
    <p>
        This is a simple 3D game of interactions I made in Unity utilizing an interwoven structure of interactions. 
        The player has a health and stamina bar, and can target an ever-approaching enemy and shoot it with an arrow from their bow. 
        This project demonstrates my experience with Unity as well as Blender, since I modeled and rigged all the assets.

    </p>

    <h3>II. Seasons, interactive visualization</h3>
    <p>
        A multi-scene interactive visualization I coded in Processing, which includes several UI features like painting clouds, 
        changing hues, cycling through the seasons, controlling the wind, and others.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>In the spring, paint your own clouds:</strong><br>

        <strong>In the fall and winter, control the wind:</strong><br>

    </p>

    <h3>III. Sencraft, game and controller</h3>
    <p>
        I coded a procedurally generated landscape that the user can traverse using a controller I custom-made for this game. 
        The controller consists of a tilt sensor and a joystick, which send their signals through Arduino, using a custom-made system of signaling, to Processing where the game is run.
